### Ammo Mod by Lollo for TPS

With help from many people on the Shadowevil discord and the authors of the Unofficial Community Patch

This modifies the amount of ammo you get from world pickups.

Each ammo type has several options for the amount you want. Most have x1 (default), x1.5, x2, and Ludicrous

------ Patch 1.1 - Added compatability with TPS (laser ammo) ------

Mod made by me. Feel free to cannabalize it, but please DO NOT REHOST IT! 

Thanks :)
