• Got rid of the bonus reload speed of the Silent Dragon.

• Reduced Sal's Damage Resistance while Gunzerking from 50% to 35%.

• Pistols have had their damage slightly decreased for Dahl, Jakobs, and Vladof. Bandit Pistols have had their Accuracy increased slightly.

• Nerfed the spawn projectile rocket damage of the Hive.

• Reworked the BUL Loaders so that they are more of a threat.

Version 1.2.0:

• Heavy changes were made regarding the Swap Speed of ALL weapons globally! The main thing in the game is to be able to utilize your Slag tools efficiently, so being able to get to them quickly makes the game interesting and fun. Thus, the change was made to make all weapons swap faster. To compensate for this, Axton's Expertise was changed to Crit Damage. Gaige's Typecast Iconoclast was changed to Reload Speed, and Fancy Calculations was changed to Shield Recharge Delay. Gaige's Short Circuit was also removed in favor of The Stare, giving DT more usage. Krieg's Blood Twitch was changed to Explosive Damage. Maya's Inertia was changed to Critical Damage, and From Rest was changed to give Damage Reduction while moving. Salvador's Quick Draw was changed to Reload Speed. Zer0's Fast Hands was changed to Steady Hands, a Kill Skill that now increases Accuracy on kills.

• The base health of all the enemies in UVHM was increased by 25%.

• Binary Boss's resistances have been changed so that he is easier to deal with.

Version 1.1.1:

• Changed a few enemies to make them a bit more challenging. Be on the lookout for BA Goliaths and Hyperion Turrets!

• Reworked weapon parts so that weapon sights also contribute to the stats of a weapon. Additionally, Hyperion and Tediore sights on guns provide bonus benefits.

• Added the Viper to Hellquist as it did not have a source before and could only World Drop.

• Axton's Expertise skill was changed slightly due to the sight changes of weapons.

Version 1.1.0:

• The level scaling of loot is now changed back so that you can get OP level gear. This should make the endgame a little bit easier to deal with.

• New event! Jackpot will drastically increase the rate at which you get legendary/unique items from Jackpot Machines. This event will last until the next update.

• Fixed a bug with Axton's Entrenched where it would display even without shields on.

• Changed Turret Guard to Double Time. Double Time increases your Movement Speed while your Turret is active.

• Changed Gaige's Battle Armor to correctly identify that it changes your Health to Armor.

• Gaige's Charged Shot was changed to Short Circuit. Short Circuit now increases Shock Damage and Reload Speed based on how low your Health is.

• Furthermore, the Catalyst and Legendary Catalyst Class Mods are being reverted back to boosting Short Circuit.

• Changed the Crossroads to have less Impulse, resulting in better Accuracy overall.

Version 1.0.5:

• New event! Show me the Eridium will drastically increase the rate at which enemies will drop Eridium. This event will last until the next update.

• Reverted the change from Health Regen on Moxxi weapons back to their original Lifesteal values. Maya's Lifetap was also changed back to Lifesteal, but at the rate of 0.6% per Grade.

• Fixed Maya's Phasecast to function properly. It was using the wrong damage values.

• Maya's Foresight Skill has been increased from 5% per Grade to 7% per Grade.

• Axton's Resourceful Skill has been increased from 5% per Grade to 6% per Grade. This is to compete with Overcharged Systems/Quicken/Smokin' Hot Barrel.

• Further adjustments to the Shotgun Vertical Grip accessory were made, including increasing the base pellet count by 1 but also still increasing the pellet count by 25%. Due to Torgue Stock and Bandit Stock no longer providing a pellet count increase, this accessory was changed to give it a slightly better effect. This is to increase the efficiency of 1 pellet shotguns in the mod while simultaneously not overtuning them to be the best accessory in the game.

• The Bekah AR still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• Further adjustments to Bandit Grip and Stock were made by reducing their Mag Size Count to Scale from PreAdd.

• The base melee damage of all characters has been increased (scaling). In compensation, Maya and Zer0's Melee Skills have been reduced.

• The SMG Hyperion Stock part was giving a slightly higher Crit DMG modifier than normal. This has been fixed.

• Changed Ancient Dragon's damage to half of what it normally is.

Version 1.0.4:

• In order to combat the scaling of high OP levels, enemies that are OP1 (Level 81) will get 20% reduced Health. This will go all the way to OP5 (Level 85) at a minimum of 100% reduced health. Level 86-Level 90 are unaffected, but they will still have -100% Health.

• BA enemies were fixed to have the correct loot pool drop.

• Pearls can now be accessed in TVHM!

• The Interfacer SG still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• The Hawkeye SR still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• The Fibber (Critical Barrel) PS still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• Further adjustments to Torgue and Bandit Stocks for Shotguns were made. They now no longer increase pellet count, but Bandit increases Mag Size and Damage, and Torgue increases Damage but has slightly reduced Spread and Recoil.

• Deathtrap's Damage has been lowered slightly. The list of attacks that were changed: Shock Beam, Overall Melee Damage, Robot Rampage.

• Maya's Inertia has been changed to improve Bullet Damage, Bullet Speed, and Swap Speed.

• Loot enemies' Health was drastically reduced.

Version 1.0.3a:

• Seraph Vendors and Seraphs were not dropping correctly from their respective sources. This has been fixed.

Version 1.0.3:

• Legendary rates in vendors were significantly toned down. The rate at which you had gotten these legendaries in vendors were too much, and it severely decreased the point of the mod, which is to go out, actively fight enemies, and get gear from them (Thanks Milk).

• EXP gains from enemies that were of a much higher level than you were significantly reduced (Thanks Milk).

• Further changes to weapon, grenade, and health vendors were made, including increasing the quality of IOTD (Item of the Day) items and removing skins from IOTD pools. Legendaries may still occasionally pop up as IOTD, but getting Legendaries in the actual spots of vendors is less likely to happen.

• The Unforgiven PS still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• New weapon named the Galahad. It can be acquired from Unmotivated Golem in DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep).

• New Maya Class Mod of Legendary Mantis.

• Increased BNK-3R's drop rates to get a Legendary.

• Increased the efficiency of Gaige's Shock Storm skill, by increasing its damage and doubling its effective radius, as well as proccing on Critical Hits AND Critical Kills.

• More Pep has been changed to give additional Shock Damage and Shock Status Effect Duration. Because of this change as well, and the redundancy between two skills, Wires Don't Talk has been lowered from 6% to 5% per grade.

• Topped Off for Sal has been changed to Law & Order. Previously, there was an unintended interaction with Topped Off and Big Bear, causing Sal to deal much more damage than listed. This has been changed to hopefully provide Sal with more survivability and gun damage outside of Gunzerking where he is weakest.

• Additionally, Gunzerking was not receiving bonuses from Last Longer. This has been fixed.

• New Pandorans in the Fight For Sanctuary DLC have been severely nerfed. Enemies will no longer have E-Tech weapons in favor of having just regular weapons, and their Shields and Health have been drastically reduced.

• Removed the Stock Market from the Pearl List and replaced with the Dark Army.

Version 1.0.2:

• The Striker SG still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• The Stomper AR still had its old SCALE Crit DMG. This had the unintended effect of its Crit DMG being incredibly powerful. This has now been reverted back to the standard PreAdd.

• Further enhancements to difficulty levels, including enemy Grenade Damage, Shield Capacity, and Badass Spawn Rate. Hope you remember to bring a Shock weapon!

• Lowered the overall max levels of TVHM (all the way up to Thousand Cuts) so that you aren't so punished for pushing through the story.

• Fixed a bug where EXP levels past Level 50 were not being calculated correctly. Also fixed the falloff and catchup rate of EXP gains if you are overleveled/underleveled, respectively.

• Fight Fire With Fire on Axton has been changed to Scrappy. This provides Gun Damage, Accuracy, and Health Regeneration while moving.

• Upshot Robot now works correctly, and now gives Gun Damage and Shock Damage, as well as the normal Melee Damage.

• Characters who have Melee Overrides are now affected by their respective Action Skill Cooldown Skills. I.E. Maya's Quicken now increases Phasecast's Cooldown Rate, and Salvador's Smokin' Hot Barrel will increase Fistful of Hurt's Cooldown Rate.

• World Drop pools are now equalled out. Before, Grenades and Class Mods had a much higher chance of being able to world drop, with Guns and Shields being very little. This has been changed to hopefully see more World Drops of higher variety. World Drops in vendors and chests have been unaffected.

• New Zer0 Class Mod of Legendary Executioner.

• Pearls now have their correct rarity.

• Sawblade Technical now has its correct values increased (the targeted hotfix was not being applied correctly).

Version 1.0.1: 

• The Actualizer SMG was given an incorrect nerf to its Fire Rate. This has been fixed.

• Gwen's Head now properly shoots in a 6 round burst.

• Increased the difficulty of the difficulty options slightly. Each difficulty level now has extra enemy scaling, Normal at 0.25% damage per level, Hard at 0.5% damage per level, and Epic and Legendary with 1% damage scaling per level. This should hopefully balance out later levels so that they are a bit more challenging and less of a cakewalk.

• With the above being said, some damage reduction and Health Regen skills have been buffed to compensate. Able for Axton was increased from 0.6% per level to 1%. Battle Armor for Gaige has been increased from 4% per level to 5%. Sexual Tyrannosaurus for Sal was increased from 0.4% per level to 0.8%.

• There was an unintended interaction with Anarchy and Blood Soaked Shields, where activating Blood Soaked Shields with Anarchy would give you almost infinite Shield upkeep while it was activated. In order to stop this interaction, Anarchy has been completely reworked. Now on reloads, it gives you a chance to dramatically increase your own stats!

• Axton's Double Up now deals Incendiary Damage versus Slag.

• Weapon parts have been reworked. You should see some less dramatic changes when it comes to weapon parts now.

• Headhunters were reverted back to their original Level 15 counterparts, due to chest levels not being able to go lower than 15.

Version 1.0.0: Released mod. Yay!
