### Chain Reaction Mod 1.0 by Lollo
Changes the percentage chance to reflect per point allocated in Chain Reaction.

  Note: Values greater than 100% have no further effect

Mod made by me. Feel free to cannabalize it, but please DO NOT REHOST IT!

Thanks :)

Choices of:
* 8% per point allows for 40% at 5/5 and 88% at 11/5 (default)
