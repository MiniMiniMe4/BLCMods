## Cleric Class Mod Buff ##

a mod by Lollo(saurusRex)

Changes skills that the Cleric class mod (Tina DLC Alignment comm for Siren) boosts

Changes it to Suspension - Kinetic Reflection - Chain Reaction

Includes Jim Raven's Purple CoM Buff (Thanks Jim!) Changes it so purple class mods buff +6 +5 +5, instead of +5 +4 +4.

Is this too good? Maybe.

Do I care? Not really.
