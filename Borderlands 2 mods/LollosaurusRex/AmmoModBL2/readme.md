### Ammo Mod by Lollo for BL2

With help from many people on the Shadowevil discord and the authors of the Unofficial Community Patch

This modifies the amount of ammo you get from world pickups.

Each ammo type has several options for the amount you want. Most have x1 (default), x1.5, x2, and Ludicrous

------ This mod will have a conflict with the UCP, in the combat rifle ammo. It's your choice on what to do with it. ------

Mod made by me. Feel free to cannabalize it, but please DO NOT REHOST IT! 

Thanks :)
